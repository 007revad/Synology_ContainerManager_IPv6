v2.0.4
- Added support for the old Synology Docker package.
- Changed to edit the dockerd.json files to preserve any existing customizations.
- Now displays contents of the edited files so you can see if they are correct.
- Added check if there's a newer version of the script available.
- Added colored text for important information. Can be disabled with -c or --color
- Bug fix for editing start_stop_status. Script was prepending a # every time it was run.

v1.0.2
- Changed to use `cidr="fe80::1/64"` so people don't need to change it unless they're using a scope global IPv6 address.

v1.0.1
  -  First release.
